# Detection-of-DDoS-attack-using-machine-learning-technique
Abstract:

The DoS/DDoS attacks are intended to bring the availability of online services down to authentic users. DDoS 
attacks disrupt the availability of Web services for an indefinite amount of time by flooding the companyâ€™s 
servers with false requests and refusing genuine ones, resulting in economic losses due to unavailability 
delivered services. To achieve the aim of information security, a model based on machine learning techniques 
is used for countering DoS/DDoS and Probing attacks in this project and to ensure accurate identification of 
DDoS attack traffic while minimizing false positives to avoid unnecessary disruption to legitimate traffic. The 
suggested model was tested using the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset, which is frequently used in the literature. 
Preprocess techniques such as Data cleaning, random subset selection, feature selection, duplication removal, 
and removal of null values were applied to the CICDDoS2019 dataset. After preprocessing the CIC
DDoS2019 datasets and using them for training the model with three different machine learning algorithms. 
Then this test dataset is fed to the machine learning model to predict the DDoS attacks by analyzing the basis 
of four performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Based on the performance, the more 
accurate algorithm is identified. Cicflowmeter is software which captures the live packets and converts those 
packets into the dataset used for testing the model. After testing, the model predicts either normal or attack 
packets. The outcomes of this project considerably expand our understanding of the effectiveness of open 
DDoS datasets. The merits and limits of these datasets in accurately detecting and reducing Distributed Denial 
of Service (DDoS) attacks are demonstrated through extensive research and evaluation. Our findings 
emphasize the necessity of using open datasets to train and evaluate intrusion detection systems, providing 
vital insights into their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
